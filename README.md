## About

A full-stack web app which allows authenticated users to track all the bugs or issues of their products. This is something very common in the tech world, but most of the available applications like Jira are built for teams and not for individuals. So this app solves that problem, it is built in a way where individual programmers can use it for their personal projects and Product Managers can create and manage employees for their small business needs.
